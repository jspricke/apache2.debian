apache2 (2.4.25-3+deb9u5) stretch; urgency=medium

  * This package upgrades mod_http2 to the version from apache2 2.4.33. This
    fixes a lot of bugs and some security issues, but it also removes the
    support for using HTTP/2 when running with mpm_prefork. HTTP/2 support
    is only provided when running with mpm_event or mpm_worker.
