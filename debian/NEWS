apache2 (2.2.3-4+etch1) unstable; urgency=low

  Note to
  - users of mod_disk_cache, and
  - users of mod_proxy who have upgraded from apache2 2.0.x (as in Debian
    "sarge" 3.1) to 2.2.3-4 (as in Debian "etch" 4.0r0). If you are directly
    upgrading from 2.0.x to 2.2.3-4+etch1 (Debian "etch" 4.0r1), or doing a 
    new installation, you are not affected.

  If mod_proxy was enabled at the time of the upgrade from 2.0.x to 2.2.3-4,
  mod_disk_cache was enabled and disk caching switched on. This could lead to
  the /var partition being filled up by the indefinitely growing disk cache.

  From version 2.2.3-4+etch1, disk caching is again switched off in the
  default configuration of mod_disk_cache, as it was in 2.0.x. If you had
  mod_proxy enabled during the upgrade from 2.0, you should check whether
  /var/cache/apache2/mod_disk_cache contains files that you don't want to be
  there.

  Users of mod_disk_cache should read the comments in
  /etc/apache2/mods-available/disk_cache.conf and check that their
  configuration is correct.

apache2 (2.2.3-4) stable; urgency=low

  Note to users upgrading from Debian 3.1 "sarge":
  
  Apache2 in Debian 4.0 "etch" is Apache 2.2.x, which has many changes from
  version 2.0.x in sarge. You will need to adjust your configuration to the
  new features and configuration syntax. In particular, there have been many
  changes related to authentication and authorization. Also, you need to
  recompile any self-compied modules.

  See the upgrading information at

    http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/upgrading.html
