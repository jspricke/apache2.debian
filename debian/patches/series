# The patch below must not be applied by quilt at extraction time.  It depends
# on some script-fu to be executed before. Have a look
# to debian/rules' prepare-custom-suexec target.
# If you're aware of that you can uncomment it at any time later and work on it
# as you wish. However, it must be shipped commented out in the final package.
